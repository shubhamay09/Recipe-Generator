# AI-Powered Recipe Generator üç≥ü§ñ

## Project Overview

The **AI-Powered Recipe Generator** is a smart, user-friendly application designed to create personalized recipes based on the ingredients you already have, your dietary preferences, and your cooking goals. This project combines **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and data-driven recipe curation to make cooking more accessible, reduce food waste, and inspire culinary creativity.

Users can input a list of available ingredients, select a cuisine type, specify meal categories (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks), and set dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten-free, keto, low-calorie). The system intelligently processes this input to generate new recipes or suggest existing ones from a curated database.

For a richer experience, the application can provide step-by-step instructions, nutritional information, and optionally, AI-generated images of the final dish.

## Key Features

* **Ingredient-based Recipe Generation:** Minimize food waste by generating recipes using ingredients you already have.
* **Cuisine and Dietary Filters:** Tailor meal suggestions based on cuisine type and dietary preferences.
* **AI-Powered Recipe Creation:** Generate unique and creative dishes using AI models.
* **Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions:** Clear guidance to help users follow recipes effortlessly.
* **Nutritional Information:** Calculate calories, protein, carbs, and fats for healthier meal planning.
* **AI Dish Visualization (Optional):** Generate images of dishes for better visualization.

## Technical Overview

* **Backend:** Integrates machine learning models for text generation, ingredient matching, and nutritional estimation.
* **Frontend:** Intuitive user interface for effortless interaction, suitable for beginners.
* **Data Sources:** Recipes can be stored locally or fetched from online APIs for dynamic content updates.
* **AI Models:** GPT-based models for generating recipe text and optionally AI models for dish image generation.

## How It Works

1. User inputs available ingredients and preferences (cuisine, dietary restrictions, meal type).
2. The system searches the recipe database or uses AI to generate a new recipe.
3. Recipe details are presented including step-by-step instructions, estimated cooking time, difficulty, and nutritional information.
4. Optional: AI-generated image of the final dish is displayed.

If you want, I can also make a **more visually appealing GitHub README** with **badges, images, and table of contents** so it looks professional and attractive.

Do you want me to do that?
