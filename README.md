Title: AI-Powered Recipe Generator

Description: The AI-Powered Recipe Generator is a smart and user-friendly application designed to create personalized recipes based on the ingredients you already have, your dietary preferences, and your cooking goals. This project aims to make cooking more accessible, reduce food waste, and inspire creativity in the kitchen by combining Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and data-driven recipe curation.

Users can simply input a list of available ingredients, choose a cuisine type, specify meal categories such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snacks, and set dietary restrictions like vegan, gluten-free, keto, or low-calorie. The system intelligently processes this input, searching a curated recipe database or generating new recipes entirely using AI models such as GPT-based text generation.

Once a recipe is selected or created, the application provides clear step-by-step cooking instructions, estimated preparation and cooking times, difficulty levels, and nutritional information including calories, protein, carbs, and fats. This helps users not only follow recipes easily but also make healthier eating decisions. For a more engaging experience, an optional AI image-generation feature can visualize the final dish, making it easier to imagine the outcome before starting.

From a technical perspective, the backend integrates machine learning models for text generation, ingredient matching, and nutritional value estimation. The frontend is designed for intuitive navigation, allowing even novice users to interact with the system effortlessly. The recipe database can be either locally stored or connected to online APIs for dynamic content updates.
